# Fourier
This is a toy project primarily intended to be an exploration of numerical calculus concepts.

For now it only depends on python standard libraries but I'm sure before long I'll want to use matplotlib and numpy, the former to visualise aspects of the project and the latter speed things up computationally. Right now pypy is sufficiently fast to do everything I'm interested in doing.
